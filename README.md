Dogevet is a web application for managing pet consultations. It supports authentication, authorization, consultations management, file uploads and more.

The backend was made with NodeJS, TypeScript, Express, and uses Prisma ORM to connect to a PostgreSQL database. 
It exposes a REST API that allows requests to be made from a client. 
You can find the client application [here](https://github.com/LeuGimrt/dogevet-frontend).

## Prerequisites
